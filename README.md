Project-Based Programming Lessons

## Philosophy

I've always been better at learing through doing. Most programming classes I've attended rely on long-winded explanation, and while I believe that is a good way to learn high level concepts, it doesn't give one the type of intuition a project can.

## Instructions

It's pretty simple. Read the requirements, write some code, run the tests. If you pass, move on, if you dont, search [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for an answer. Welcome to programming!

## Python

I learned to program in C, and because of that, I'll always harbor a love for that language. But if I'm being honest, most people don't need to know the next-to-the metal concepts that are a prerequisite for doing almost anything useful in C. Python on the other hand is very easy to learn and get things done in. I may eventually add some lessons in JavaScript so that I can get my C syntax fix, but for the time being let's keep it simple.
